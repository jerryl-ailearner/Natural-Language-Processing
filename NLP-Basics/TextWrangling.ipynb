       " 'Wie lange wollen wir eigentlich so eine Entwicklung akzeptieren , die auf die zunehmende Spaltung zwischen armen und reichen Regionen hinausläuft ?',\n",
       " 'Während im fünften Bericht über die Situation der Regionen die Arbeitslosigkeit in den armen Regionen siebenmal höher lag als in den reichen Regionen , spricht der sechste Bericht bereits von einer achtmal höheren Arbeitslosigkeit , obwohl europäische Strukturfondsmittel in die Regionen fließen .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb wundert es natürlich niemanden , daß bereits im Vorfeld der neuen Strukturfondsverordnung die Forderung laut wird , die Mittel effizienter und konzentrierter einzusetzen für die europäischen Ziele hohes Beschäftigungsniveau und nachhaltige Entwicklung , um nur einige zu nennen .',\n",
       " 'Das Parlament , aber vor allen Dingen die Mitgliedstaaten forderten massiv Verbesserungen .',\n",
       " 'Das war dann aber recht schnell vergessen , als die Kommission das neue Instrument dafür , die Leitlinien , entwickelt hatte und mehr Verbindlichkeit in die Forderung nach Effizienz , Konzentration und Verwaltungsvereinfachung beim Einsatz der Europäischen Strukturfonds bringen wollte .',\n",
       " 'Dann beriefen sich die Regierungen in den Mitgliedstaaten auf das Subsidiaritätsprinzip und wollten das Geld nur einfach rübergeschoben haben .',\n",
       " 'Vom Berliner Gipfel 1999 blieb dann nur noch der indikative Charakter der Leitlinien übrig .',\n",
       " 'Dieser verpflichtet jedoch die Kommission zumindest dazu , nur die Programme zu genehmigen , mit denen die europäischen Ziele auch wirklich erreicht werden können .',\n",
       " 'Wenn ich auch Zweifel habe , daß dieses indikative Instrument wirklich ausreicht , um Effizienz und Konzentration zu erreichen und die europäischen Ziele wirklich umzusetzen , so ist doch Fakt , daß die Leitlinien in den Verhandlungen für das gemeinschaftliche Förderkonzept eine zentrale Rolle spielen werden .',\n",
       " 'Wenn die europäische Ebene ernst genommen werden will , müssen sie das auch !',\n",
       " 'Der Parlament hatte nicht die Möglichkeit , inhaltlich auf die Leitlinien einzugehen , weil es erst konsultiert wurde , als die Legislaturperiode längst vorbei war .',\n",

       " 'Zweitens : Er deckt die Mängel im Kommissionsdokument auf .',\n",
       " 'So wurde beispielsweise im zentralen Teil der Strukturfonds die Partnerschaft schlichtweg vergessen .',\n",

       " 'Die Frage , warum es vergessen wurde , ist bis heute nicht beantwortet worden .',\n",
       " 'Hier stellt das Parlament zentrale Forderungen .',\n",
       " 'Es erwartet von der Kommission , daß sie nur die Programme genehmigt , die in einer solchen Partnerschaft entstanden sind .',\n",
       " 'Es wundert mich schon , liebe KollegInnen von der Konservativen Fraktion , daß ich so plötzlich über Nacht Änderungsanträge vorfinde , die den dezentralen Ansatz streichen wollen .',\n",
       " 'Ich kann nur sagen , gehen Sie damit in Ihre Regionen und erklären Sie Ihren Wählerinnen und Wählern , warum in den Regionen nicht das europäische Prinzip der Dezentralität verwirklicht werden soll .',\n",
       " 'Ich kann Ihnen sagen , Sie werden nicht ganz ungeschoren davonkommen .',\n",
       " 'Es kann nicht sein , daß wir hier Prinzipien vereinbaren , und wenn es um die Umsetzung geht , macht wieder jeder was er will .',\n",

       " 'Ich finde es gut , daß die Kommission hier streng bleibt .',\n",
       " 'Damit knüpfe ich an den letzten Punkt an .',\n",
       " 'Die Leitlinien müssen konkreter Gradmesser dafür sein , ob der Artikel 1 der Verordnung wirklich umgesetzt wird .',\n",
       " 'Ich erwarte von der Kommission , daß die Leitlinien , die ja wirklich genügend Flexibilität darstellen , wirklich der Maßstab für die Verhandlungen sind .',\n",
       " 'Wir vertreten die europäische Position .',\n",
       " 'Das heißt , Nachhaltigkeit in der Verkehrspolitik muß genauso berücksichtigt sein wie der Frauenanteil in der Förderung sowie die Tatsache , daß jedes Programm auch den Globalzuschuß vorsieht und dadurch möglich wird , daß es eine nachhaltige Städteentwicklung und auch wirklich Modellprojekte im ländlichen Raum gibt .',\n",
       " 'Ich erwarte , daß das die Ergebnisse der gemeinschaftlichen Förderkonzepte sind und daß Sie hier nicht wieder einknicken .',\n",

       " 'Es sind die letzten Jahre , in denen wir die europäische Strukturpolitik in diesem hohen Finanzmaße umsetzen können .',\n",
       " 'Danach kommen viele Länder dazu , und dann müssen wir sowieso viel bessere , effizientere und konzentriertere Strukturen schaffen .',\n",
       " 'Und das ist erst der Anfang .',\n",
       " 'Deswegen erwarte ich von der Kommission , daß sie in den Verhandlungen die Forderungen des Parlaments ernst nimmt und daß sie hier die europäische Position wirklich umsetzt und so einer fortschrittlichen Regionalpolitik endlich eine Chance gibt .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , ich freue mich ganz besonders , daß mein erster Beitrag im Europäischen Parlament einem Thema gewidmet ist , das in dem Teil des Vereinigten Königreichs , den ich in diesem Parlament vertrete , nämlich Wales , als das wichtigste Thema überhaupt gilt .',\n",
       " 'Wie Sie wissen , wurde einem beträchtlichen Teil von Wales gemäß Strukturfondsprogramm der Status einer Ziel-1-Region zuerkannt .',\n",
       " 'Und so erwarten auch viele Menschen in Wales , daß die Europäischen Strukturfonds ihnen bei der Überwindung einiger der gewaltigen Schwierigkeiten , mit denen wir ohne Zweifel zu kämpfen haben , hilft .',\n",

       " 'Die Kluft zwischen Arm und Reich wird immer tiefer .',\n",
       " 'Wir erhoffen uns daher vom Strukturfondsprogramm nicht nur eine wirtschaftliche Umstrukturierung , sondern eine weitreichendere Verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen Basis des Landesteils .',\n",
       " 'Was uns jedoch schwer zu schaffen macht , ist die Tatsache , daß die Gewährung von Unterstützung im Rahmen der Strukturfonds in gewisser Weise als Erfolg der Regierung verbucht wird .',\n",
       " 'Dabei ist es doch nur ein weiterer Ausdruck für die immensen Schwierigkeiten , vor denen Wales steht .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb möchte ich auf einige Probleme aufmerksam machen , denen sich die Kommission vorrangig widmen sollte .',\n",
       " 'Wir erwarten von der Kommission , daß sie Problemen im Zusammenhang mit der Zusätzlichkeit mehr Aufmerksamkeit widmet .',\n",
       " 'Wir halten es für falsch , daß die entsprechenden Zahlen in gewisser Weise in den Zahlen für das Vereinigte Königreich untergegangen sind .',\n",
       " 'Wir erwarten von der Kommission , daß es einen ergänzenden Finanzierungsanteil für die Vorhaben gibt .',\n",
       " 'Wir erwarten , daß sie die britische Regierung drängt sicherzustellen , daß der private Sektor , der zweifellos die treibende Kraft im Hinblick auf die Bereitstellung von Mitteln im Rahmen der Strukturfonds darstellen muß , in die Planung einbezogen wird .',\n",
       " 'Schließlich bitten wir die Kommission , für mehr Transparenz bei der Ausgabe von Strukturfondsgeldern zu sorgen .',\n",
       " 'Zu vielem , was in diesem Parlament passiert , mangelt es an Transparenz .',\n",

       " 'Zunächst möchte ich mich zum Forschungsaspekt äußern .',\n",
       " 'Wir erachten es als sehr positiv , daß die Berichterstatterin den Vorschlag unseres Ausschusses in ihre Schlußfolgerungen aufgenommen hat , wonach in den Kohäsionsländern die wissenschaftliche Infrastruktur ausgedehnt werden muß , indem Hochschulen und Bildungseinrichtungen an solchen Orten geschaffen werden , an denen sie besser als bisher den Bewohnern unterentwickelter Regionen zur Verfügung stehen , und es Absolventen erleichtert wird , in ihren Heimatregionen zu verbleiben .',\n",
       " 'Das wird durch staatliche Maßnahmen ermöglicht , und eine solche Dezentralisation der höheren Ausbildung ist nachgerade eine sinnvolle Politik für eine ausgeglichene Entwicklung .',\n",
       " 'In einer anderen Frage , auf die wir besonders unter dem Blickwinkel der Industriepolitik aufmerksam machen möchten , hätten wir uns gewünscht , daß die Kommission bei der Planung der Koordinierung von Kohäsionsfonds und Strukturfonds die Auswirkungen des Wachstums des Dienstleistungssektors , des elektronischen Handels und der Nutzung des Internets mehr berücksichtigt hätte .',\n",
       " 'Armut und Reichtum hingen früher mehr von der Wirtschaftsstruktur ab .',\n",
       " 'Reich waren jene Regionen , in denen es Arbeitsplätze in der Industrie gab .',\n",
       " 'Jetzt sind aus diesen Regionen teilweise Problemfälle und arme Gebiete geworden , wo auch in neue Branchen wie Elektronik und Dienstleistungen investiert werden muß , weil diese als zukunftsweisende Bereiche gelten .',\n",
       " 'Diese Tatsache hat der federführende Ausschuß meines Erachtens in seinem Bericht nicht ausreichend berücksichtigt , so daß ich die Kommission im Namen des Industrieausschusses darauf hinweisen möchte .',\n",
       " 'Als Ausschuß für Energie hätten wir uns schließlich noch gewünscht , daß die Förderung der erneuerbaren Energien aus den Mitteln des Kohäsions- und Strukturfonds eine noch größere Rolle gespielt hätte .',\n",
       " 'Auf diese Weise hätte mittels Koordinierung die Nutzung dieser erneuerbaren Energieformen so entwickelt werden können , daß unzureichende Finanzmittel des Energieprogramms durch diese umfangreicheren Mittel kompensiert werden .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , ich möchte Frau Schroedter ganz herzlich für die von ihr zu diesem Thema geleistete Arbeit danken .',\n",
       " 'Gleichzeitig möchte ich erklären , daß ich im Namen meiner Kollegin Frau Flautre spreche , die die Stellungnahme im Auftrag des Ausschusses für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten erarbeitet hat und leider erkrankt ist .',\n",
       " 'Ich möchte Ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf die Änderungsanträge 1 und 2 lenken , die vom Ausschuß für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten vorgelegt , jedoch vom Ausschuß für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr abgelehnt wurden .',\n",
       " 'Darin geht es um die Sozialwirtschaft und die Notwendigkeit der Bereitstellung von \" social risk capital \" und der finanziellen Unterstützung von lokalen Programmen zur Schaffung von Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten und zur Stärkung des sozialen Zusammenhalts .',\n",
       " 'Das Parlament sah in der Sozialwirtschaft stets einen wichtigen potentiellen Anbieter von Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten .',\n",
       " 'Die genannten Änderungsanträge decken sich mit der vom Parlament vertretenen Ansicht , daß die soziale Ausgrenzung ein ernstes Problem darstellt , das konstruktive Maßnahmen erfordert .',\n",
       " 'Wir hoffen , daß diejenigen , die eine Ablehnung dieser Änderungsanträge in Betracht ziehen , sowohl dem Parlament als auch ihren Arbeit suchenden Bürgern triftige Gründe für ihre Entscheidung nennen können .',\n",
       " 'Frau Flautre verwies in ihrem Bericht auch auf einen Bereich , dem es stark an Koordinierung mangelt , wenngleich gerade hier beträchtlicher Koordinierungsbedarf besteht .',\n",
       " 'Die Vorschläge der Kommission beziehen sich auf die vier Pfeiler der Beschäftigungsstrategie und die fünf Aktionsbereiche des Europäischen Sozialfonds .',\n",
       " 'Doch das Fehlen konkreter Leitlinien ist um so bedauerlicher , als die Idee , die ESF-Interventionen mit der Beschäftigungsstrategie zu verknüpfen , im Planungszeitraum 2000-2006 erstmals umgesetzt wird .',\n",
       " 'Dieses Versäumnis weckt jedenfalls den Eindruck , daß auch die Kommission nicht weiß , wie eine möglichst umfassende Koordinierung zwischen den ESF-Interventionen , die nach dreieinhalb Jahren einer Prüfung unterliegen , und den jährlichen Nationalen Aktionsplänen für die Beschäftigung der Mitgliedstaaten zu bewerkstelligen ist .',\n",
       " 'Wir hoffen , daß uns die Kommission davon überzeugen kann , daß es sich dabei lediglich um ein Versehen handelt , das umgehend korrigiert wird .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , meine Damen und Herren !',\n",
       " 'Der von der Kommission in Erfüllung ihres Mandats unterbreitete Vorschlag ist für den Ausschuß für Landwirtschaft und ländliche Entwicklung ein vernünftiger Ausgangspunkt .',\n",
       " 'Ich möchte allerdings an dieser Stelle hervorheben , daß uns dieser Ausgangspunkt die vor uns stehenden Herausforderungen aufzeigt : angesichts der Veränderungen in den wirtschaftlichen Tätigkeiten aller Art infolge der schwindenden Bedeutung des Landwirtschaftssektors innerhalb der verschiedenen Einkommensquellen der ländlichen Gesellschaft die Bevölkerung im ländlichen Raum zu halten .',\n",
       " 'Zusammen mit den Unzulänglichkeiten in der Infrastruktur und im Dienstleistungsbereich und einem allgemein sehr spärlichen , stark saisonabhängigen und wenig diversifizierten Beschäftigungsangebot verstärken sie die Abwanderung aus den ländlichen Gebieten .',\n",
       " 'Die Folgen lassen nicht auf sich warten .',\n",
       " 'Es sind die jungen Menschen , die abwandern , diejenigen , die Ausbildung und Beschäftigung außerhalb der ländlichen Gebiete finden , was sich in diesen Regionen sehr ungünstig auswirkt .',\n",
       " 'Diese fehlende Infrastruktur ist wiederum ein Hindernis für die Ansiedlung von Unternehmen und die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen .',\n",
       " 'Man muß sich vor Augen halten , daß der ländliche Raum nahezu vier Fünftel des Territoriums der Europäischen Union ausmacht .',\n",
       " 'Die Landwirtschaft stellt nur 5,5 % der Arbeitsplätze der Union .',\n",
       " 'Darüber hinaus sind drei Viertel unserer Landwirte Nebenerwerbslandwirte und auf zusätzliche Einkommensquellen angewiesen .',\n",
       " 'Aus diesem Grund ist es eines der wichtigsten und weitreichendsten Ziele , die wir uns in der Europäischen Union stellen sollten , Anstrengungen zur Schaffung neuer Arbeitsplätze in den ländlichen Gebieten außerhalb des Agrarsektors zu unternehmen , unter anderem in den Bereichen ländlicher Tourismus , Sport , Kultur , Sanierung der Ressourcen , Umstellung von Unternehmen , neue Technologien , Dienstleistungen usw.',\n",
       " 'Doch obwohl die Landwirtschaft keine ausschließliche Rolle mehr spielt , ist sie weiterhin wichtig , nicht nur , um den wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Niedergang der ländlichen Gebiete und das Entstehen von weiteren Geisterstädten zu verhindern , sondern auch , weil den Landwirten eine grundlegende Rolle bei der Bewirtschaftung des Territoriums , dem Erhalt der Artenvielfalt und dem Umweltschutz zukommt .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb treten wir für eine Landwirtschaftspolitik und eine ländliche Entwicklung ein , die mit unseren Zielen im Einklang steht , sowie dafür , daß die ländlichen Gebiete an der Schwelle zum 21. Jahrhundert wettbewerbsfähig und multifunktional sein müssen , sowohl in bezug auf den landwirtschaftlichen Aspekt als auch hinsichtlich der Öffnung für die Vielfalt nicht landwirtschaftlicher Tätigkeiten .',\n",
       " 'Es ist wichtig , allgemeinen Kriterien der Raumordnung und der ausgewogenen Bevölkerungsstruktur vorrangige Beachtung zu schenken und die Schlußfolgerungen zu berücksichtigen , zu denen der Ausschuß für Landwirtschaft und ländliche Entwicklung in fünf Hauptaspekten gelangt ist , die nur teilweise vom Ausschuß für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr in seinen Punkten 16 und 17 aufgegriffen worden sind .',\n",
       " 'Abschließend möchte ich die Kommission ersuchen , diese fünf Punkte bei der Formulierung der Schlußfolgerungen der vier Pfeiler zu berücksichtigen , denn nach meiner Auffassung muß die Bindung der Bevölkerung an den ländlichen Raum eines der vorrangigen Ziele der Europäischen Union bilden .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !',\n",

       " 'Um der Erreichung dieser Ziele einen schnellen und wirksamen Impuls zu verleihen , halten wir es für notwendig , daß die Unternehmer , das heißt diejenigen , die Arbeitsplätze schaffen , die wirklichen Unternehmergeist zeigen und tatsächlich neue Beschäftigungsquellen garantieren , in diese Initiative eingebunden werden .',\n",

       " 'Gleichfalls wichtig für das Erreichen unserer Ziele , für die Überwindung der regionalen Ungleichheiten und für die Erschließung von Arbeitsplätzen ist der entschlossene Einsatz für die neuen Technologien , für die Verkehrs- und Kommunikationsnetze und für die erneuerbaren Energien .',\n",
       " 'Und dies alles - wohlgemerkt unter Mitwirkung der Privatwirtschaft , die ihre Anstrengungen mit denen der öffentlichen Verwaltungen vereint , damit sie sich ergänzen und sich zu keinem Zeitpunkt behindern oder ausschließen schafft gesellschaftlichen Reichtum und Arbeitsplätze .',\n",

       " 'Ich möchte daher die Kommission auf zwei Punkte hinweisen : Erstens muß die Konzertierung als Instrument der Koordinierung und der Beteiligung sämtlicher lokaler und regionaler Marktteilnehmer an den Entscheidungen optimal genutzt werden , um speziell Ungleichgewichte und Ungleichheiten zu vermeiden ; zweitens bedarf es einer Vereinfachung und transparenteren Gestaltung der Verwaltungsprozesse , die sich allzu häufig unnötig in die Länge ziehen und derart kompliziert sind , daß sie , was vor allem von den europäischen KMU beanstandet wird , ein Hindernis für den Zugang zu den Fonds darstellen .',\n",

       " 'Doch der dem Haus heute vorliegende Bericht ist ein klassisches Beispiel dafür , daß wir , wenn wir nicht aufpassen , Ideen entwickeln , die zwar phantastisch klingen , für die Bürger , die direkt von ihnen profitieren sollen , jedoch u. U. von wenig Belang sind .',\n",

       " 'Es geht uns erstens um eine ordnungsgemäße Verwendung der Mittel aus den Struktur- und dem Kohäsionsfonds .',\n",
       " 'Die Erfahrungen der Vergangenheit zeigen , daß wir als die gewählten Vertreter der europäischen Steuerzahler finanzielle Redlichkeit und Transparenz bei der Auszahlung dieser Gelder und der damit verbundenen Rechnungsprüfung fordern sollten , ja müssen .',\n",
       " 'Mit unseren Änderungen und Zusätzen wollen wir das erreichen , was bei der Gewährung von Zuschüssen als Indikator für die wirtschaftlich günstigste Lösung dienen kann .',\n",
       " 'Zweitens fließen nur allzu oft riesige Summen in Projekte , deren Ergebnisse sich zu Beginn des Programmzeitraums einfach noch nicht klar abschätzen lassen .',\n",
       " 'Und bleibt der erhoffte Erfolg aus , gibt es keine effektive Möglichkeit , das Projekt zur Halbzeit oder am Ende dieses Zeitraums tatsächlich zu beenden .',\n",
       " 'Mit unseren Zusätzen fordern wir daher , daß praktische und durchsetzbare Möglichkeiten des Ausstiegs aus einem Programm vorgesehen werden , mit denen wir uns nicht nur gegen weitere Kosten absichern , die häufig zu Lasten des Steuerzahlers gehen , sondern mit denen auch verhindert wird , daß , wie in der Vergangenheit so oft geschehen , Gelder verschwendet werden .',\n",
       " 'Und schließlich fordern wir Veränderungen in bezug auf Schwerpunkt und Methodik der Mittelauszahlung .',\n",
       " 'So sollte der private Sektor , durch den das Element der finanziellen Realität in die Finanzierungsüberlegungen eingebracht wird , stärker integriert werden .',\n",
       " 'Auch sollte man hinsichtlich der Art der zu fördernden Projekte den Schwerpunkt von Kleinvorhaben auf Ertragsbasis , die sich nur schwer überwachen lassen , auf Investitionsvorhaben verlagern , bei denen der Nutzen in der Mehrzahl der Fälle offen auf der Hand liegt .',\n",
       " 'Damit wird man den Rufen nach mehr Transparenz bei der Verwendung der Gelder gerecht , und der Versuchung , das lokale Steueraufkommen in Gebieten , in denen entsprechende Projekte durchgeführt werden , unnötig über längere Zeit zu belasten , wird erfolgreich entgegengewirkt .',\n",
       " 'Zudem macht das Parlament damit deutlich , wie ernst es den Ruf nach derartigen Reformen nimmt .',\n",
       " 'Diese Änderungen , sollten sie heute von diesem Hohen Haus angenommen werden , sind meiner Ansicht nach ein weiterer entscheidender Schritt zur Erreichung der historisch bedeutsamen Ziele , für die die Fonds ursprünglich eingerichtet worden waren , nämlich die finanziell nachhaltige Unterstützung der benachteiligten Gebiete in der Europäischen Union , in der der Lebensstandard nicht durch Almosen , sondern konkrete Hilfe auf ein menschenwürdiges Niveau angehoben werden muß .',\n",
       " 'Ich fordere das Haus auf , diesen Änderungen zuzustimmen .',\n",

       " 'Trotz der bisherigen Maßnahmen sind diese Ungleichgewichte nämlich noch recht ausgeprägt , in bezug auf die Arbeitslosigkeit sogar inakzeptabel .',\n",
       " 'Damit die Ziele dieser Politiken möglichst umfassend verwirklicht werden können , müssen sie koordiniert und auf der Grundlage wohldurchdachter , sinnvoller Leitlinien umgesetzt werden .',\n",
       " 'Vergessen wir nicht , daß diese Politiken , wenn sie denn wirksam sind , auch für den europäischen Bürger sichtbar werden , der eine unmittelbare Verbesserung seiner Lebensqualität erkennt !',\n",
       " 'Bedenken wir außerdem , daß die entlegenen und Inselregionen der Europäischen Union besondere Beachtung verdienen , denn auf Grund ihrer geographischen Lage sind sie in ihrer wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Entwicklung erheblich benachteiligt - es sei denn , die Kommission beabsichtigt , Brücken zu bauen oder unterseeische Tunnel anzulegen , um sie mit dem europäischen Festland zu verbinden .',\n",
       " 'Lassen Sie mich abschließend anmerken , daß die Strukturpolitiken insgesamt flexibler gestaltet werden müssen , damit sie den veränderten Bedingungen und damit den neuen Herausforderungen und Chancen entsprechen , die das neue Jahrtausend , für das wir alle das Beste hoffen , mit sich bringt .',\n",

       " 'Der erste ist die maßgebliche und zentrale Bedeutung , die wir dem Grundsatz des wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalts nach wie vor beimessen .',\n",
       " 'Wir geben unserer Besorgnis über Meldungen Ausdruck , denen wir entnehmen , daß die Bedeutung dieses Ziels in den Anschauungen der Kommission zunehmend nachläßt .',\n",
       " 'Wir sind nach wie vor der Ansicht , daß der wirtschaftliche und soziale Zusammenhalt ein zentrales Ziel der Union ist .',\n",
       " 'Zweitens stimme ich dem zu , was ich hier bereits von einem Kollegen über die Thematik der Inseln gehört habe , und ich möchte ebenfalls auf die Gebiete in äußerster Randlage aufmerksam machen .',\n",
       " 'In Zukunft würden wir uns über mehr Mut bei der Behandlung des Themas der Gebiete in äußerster Randlage freuen , wie das im Fall meines Heimatlandes für die Inselgruppen der Azoren und Madeiras gilt .',\n",
       " 'Ich nutze diese Gelegenheit , um zu fragen , ob uns die Kommission über die Gründe aufklären kann , warum sich der Bericht der Kommission über die Gebiete in äußerster Randlage verzögert , der im Parlament seit längerem erwartet wird .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident !',\n",
       " 'Zunächst meinen Dank an die Berichterstatterin , auch für die bereitwillige Aufnahme von Anregungen unsererseits in den Bericht .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren , Herr Kommissar !',\n",
       " 'Mit Hilfe von Leitlinien soll den Mitgliedstaaten eine Orientierung zum Erreichen der Reformziele im Rahmen der Programmierung angeboten werden .',\n",
       " 'Die diesbezüglichen Vorgaben der Kommission stellen aber entgegen ihrem Anspruch , Orientierung zu geben , vielmehr einen Angebotskatalog möglicher Maßnahmen im Rahmen der Politikfelder dar .',\n",
       " 'Richtung zu geben und Prioritäten zu setzen , ist jedoch ihr eigentlicher Sinn .',\n",
       " 'Ich gehe mit der Berichterstatterin konform , daß das Kommissionsdokument leider zu wenig Empfehlungen an die Mitgliedstaaten zur Verwaltungsvereinfachung enthält , und unterstreiche Forderungen wie Konzentration bei Verhandlungen auf die Förderung eines günstigen Umfeldes für arbeitsintensive kleine und mittelständische Unternehmen , auf eine klare Zielsetzung für alternative Finanzierungsquellen einschließlich Regelungen für Risikokapital und private Finanzierung , auf betriebliche Starthilfen einschließlich neuer Informationstechnologien sowie Investitionen in innovativen Bereichen .',\n",
       " 'Meine besondere Unterstützung gilt einem Änderungsantrag meiner Fraktion zu Ziffer 10 , der eine angemessene Einbeziehung des privaten Sektors bei der Planung und Durchführung der Projekte sicherstellen soll .',\n",
       " 'Ich würde mich freuen , Frau Schroedter , wenn Sie diesen Änderungsantrag gerade auch unter dem Aspekt der Subsidiarität in Ihre positiven Erwägungen mit einbeziehen würden .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar !',\n",
       " 'Im Ausschuß für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten vertraten wir einhellig den Standpunkt , daß die Unterstützung der Interventionen der Struktur- und Kohäsionsfonds zugunsten besserer Beschäftigungschancen für die Arbeitslosen und einer Gleichstellung von Männern und Frauen von strategischer und prioritärer Bedeutung ist .',\n",
       " 'Leider hat der ausgezeichnete Bericht Schroedter diesen Gedanken nicht in Betracht gezogen , obwohl es zahlreiche Beweise dafür gibt - wir werden das später im Bericht Berend sehen - , wie diese Fonds den weniger entwickelten Regionen wirklich hervorragend helfen , den Abstand zwischen ihnen und den am stärksten entwickelten Regionen Europas zu überbrücken .',\n",
       " 'Sie wachsen , aber in bezug auf das BIP .',\n",
       " 'Ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit steigt , aber der wachsende Reichtum erreicht nicht alle , weil sich die Zahl der Arbeitsplätze nicht erhöht und der Unterschied bei den Beschäftigungschancen in den einzelnen Regionen fortbesteht .',\n",
       " 'Herr Kommissar , lesen Sie die Stellungnahme des Ausschusses für Beschäftigung und soziale Angelegenheiten , und räumen Sie ihr Vorrang ein , denn dies ist das große Problem der Bürger .',\n",
       " 'Und berücksichtigen Sie bei der Überprüfung , bei der Zuweisung der Reserven , strategisch die Anforderungen an die Beschäftigung , denn dies ist es letztendlich , was die Struktur- und Kohäsionsfonds erfordern .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , die Leitlinien müssen so gestaltet werden , daß sie die Programme der wichtigen fünf Jahre von 2002 bis 2006 vernünftig ausrichten und ihre Effizienz verstärken , damit Ziele wie die nachhaltige Entwicklung sowie die Beschäftigungsförderung , insbesondere für Frauen und Jugendliche , endlich Wirklichkeit werden und die Ausgewogenheit zwischen der Wirtschafts- und Sozial- sowie der Umweltpolitik gewahrt bleibt .',\n",
       " 'Besonders wichtig sind die Bewältigung der angewachsenen Probleme in den Städten , die Beschäftigungssicherung im ländlichen Raum , die Förderung der Agrarregionen und natürlich - wie in Artikel 158 des Vertrages vorgesehen - die Gewährung gleicher Entwicklungschancen für die Inseln der Europäischen Union , selbstverständlich auch für die griechischen , die die Hälfte der Inseln der Union ausmachen .',\n",
       " 'Die Kohäsionspolitik muß weiter gestärkt werden , denn ein Europa mit einem beträchtlichen Gefälle im Lebensniveau zwischen den einzelnen Regionen ist weder glaubwürdig noch kann es Bestand haben .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten !',\n",
       " 'Ich habe ihren Ausführungen , Ihrer stellenweisen Kritik sowie Ihren Vorschlägen im Zusammenhang mit dem Bericht von Frau Schroedter aufmerksam und mit großem Interesse zugehört .',\n",
       " 'Wir alle , Frau Berichterstatterin , meine Damen und Herren , kennen die Gründe , die Termine , die Verzögerungen - ich komme gleich darauf zu sprechen .',\n",
       " 'Doch heute diskutieren wir über den Bericht , der für mich und die Kommission zum richtigen Zeitpunkt vorliegt , da es um die Leitlinien 2000-2006 geht und wir gerade mit der neuen regionalen Programmplanungsphase beginnen .',\n",
       " 'Frau Schroedter , Sie haben zu Recht daran erinnert , daß es im wesentlichen Aufgabe der Mitgliedstaaten und der Regionen ist , ihre eigenen Entwicklungsprioritäten festzulegen .',\n",
       " 'Doch aufgrund der Kofinanzierung der Programme durch die Europäische Union ist es notwendig und richtig , daß auch gemeinschaftliche Prioritäten berücksichtigt werden , wie sie hier diskutiert und verabschiedet werden , um diese gemeinschaftliche Dimension des wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalts zu fördern , an die viele von Ihnen mit Nachdruck erinnert haben .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb , meine Damen und Herren , möchte ich kurz auf die Bedeutung und Struktur der Leitlinien eingehen , bevor ich auf die Bemerkungen oder die Kritik , die Sie , Frau Schroedter , oder auch Sie , meine Damen und Herren , vorgebracht haben , zu sprechen komme .',\n",
       " 'In bezug auf die Bedeutung und Struktur der Leitlinien haben der Ausschußvorsitzende Hatzidakis , die Berichterstatterin sowie Frau McCarthy daran erinnert , daß die Leitlinien den Zweck haben , die nationalen und regionalen Stellen bei der Vorbereitung ihrer Programmierungsstrategie für die Ziele 1 , 2 und 3 der Strukturfonds sowie deren Verbindungen zum Kohäsionsfonds zu unterstützen .',\n",
       " 'Dabei geht es darum , die Prioritäten der Kommission , die von den Erfahrungen bei der Umsetzung der Programme ausgehen , sowie die derzeitigen Gemeinschaftspolitiken im Zusammenhang mit den Strukturmaßnahmen darzulegen .',\n",
       " 'Diese Prioritäten sollen - wie hier mehrfach gefordert wurde - zu einer bessern Nutzung , einer optimalen , effizienten Nutzung der Gemeinschaftsinterventionen beitragen ; dazu gehört gegebenenfalls auch die Leistungsreserve , Herr Bradbourn , die insbesondere das Ziel hat , eine optimale und effiziente Verwendung der öffentlichen Gelder Europas sicherzustellen .',\n",
       " 'Und wenn ich von optimaler Verwendung spreche , meine ich sowohl die nationale als auch die regionale Ebene ; und , Herr Seppänen , auf nationaler Ebene meine ich damit auch die Verbindung zum Kohäsionsfonds .',\n",
       " 'Soviel zum Ziel der Leitlinien .',\n",
       " 'In bezug auf den Inhalt wissen Sie , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , daß die Leitlinien von drei strategischen Prinzipien ausgehen , an die die Berichterstatterin in ihren Ausführungen eben mit aller Deutlichkeit und gleichzeitig mit großem Nachdruck erinnert hat .',\n",
       " 'Die erste Priorität liegt auf der Verbesserung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der regionalen Wirtschaft , um in allen Wirtschaftsbereichen , insbesondere aber im privaten Sektor , wie Herr Berend ausführte , möglichst viele vollwertige und auf Dauer angelegte Stellen zu schaffen ; Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Wirtschaft der Regionen , aller Regionen , insbesondere von Wales , Herr Evans , aber nicht nur von Wales .',\n",
       " 'Hinzufügen möchte ich hier noch , weil einige Abgeordnete gerade darauf hingewiesen haben , da dies ihrer Meinung nach anscheinend vergessen wurde , die regionalen Wirtschaften der durch ihre Lage benachteiligten europäischen Regionen - also die Randregionen , die Inselregionen und natürlich auch die Regionen in äußerster Randlage .',\n",
       " 'In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich auf die Ausführungen von Herrn Ribeiro i Castro eingehen und ihm sagen , daß , die Kommission - wie ich an die jeweiligen Präsidenten der Regionen in äußerster Randlage geschrieben habe - um einige Wochen Fristverlängerung für die Vorlage ihres Berichts gebeten hat .',\n",
       " 'Die Mitteilungen der einzelnen Regierungen zu den Regionen in äußerster Randlage haben wir ziemlich spät erhalten , doch soll das keine Entschuldigung , sondern eine Erklärung sein .',\n",
       " 'Nun geht es darum , diese Unterlagen zu berücksichtigen und sehr sorgfältig auszuwerten .',\n",
       " 'Am 23. November habe ich an einem Treffen von Vertretern der Regionen in äußerster Randlage teilgenommen , und wir waren uns in der Kommission einig , daß wir einige Wochen mehr Zeit brauchen , um einen Bericht vorlegen zu können , der den sehr schwerwiegenden und bedeutsamen Problemen sowie den Erwartungen dieser Regionen in äußerster Randlage gerecht wird ; ich danke Ihnen für Ihr Verständnis .',\n",
       " 'So weit meine Ausführungen zur ersten Priorität , der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit auf regionaler Ebene .',\n",
       " 'Die zweite Priorität , die auch von Ihnen mehrfach genannt wurde , insbesondere auch von Herrn Puerta - ich gehe im übrigen nicht von einer Rangfolge der Prioritäten untereinander aus - , liegt auf der Verbesserung des sozialen Zusammenhalts und der Beschäftigung , wobei in Zukunft insbesondere die Humanressourcen besser geförderte werden sollen .',\n",
       " 'Meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , wenn man feststellen muß , daß in der Europäischen Union die Unterschiede zwischen den Staaten geringer geworden sind - was im übrigen für den Kohäsionsfonds und dessen Effizienz spricht - , aber gleichzeitig bei der Arbeitslosigkeit - wie die Berichterstatterin schreibt - die Unterschiede zwischen den 15 oder 20 reichsten Regionen und den 15 oder 20 ärmsten bzw. am stärksten benachteiligten Regionen größer geworden sind , dann ist das eine Situation , die unerträglich und durch nichts zu rechtfertigen ist .',\n",
       " 'Aufgrund meinen Vorstellungen vom Aufbau Europas und von regionaler Entwicklungspolitik im besonderen halte ich das für eine Situation , die ich nicht akzeptieren kann .',\n",
       " 'Ich habe die Absicht , im Rahmen meiner Möglichkeiten und mit Ihrer Unterstützung sämtliche Mittel , für die ich Verantwortung trage , für eine verbesserte soziale , menschliche und territoriale Kohäsion zu verwenden , um zu verhindern , daß es , wie ich es vor diesem Hause nannte , ein Europa der zwei Geschwindigkeiten gibt , ein Europa der schicken Stadtviertel und ein Europa der armen Vorstädte .',\n",
       " 'Das dritte Ziel besteht in einer städtischen und ländlichen Entwicklung im Rahmen einer ausgewogenen Raumordnungspolitik .',\n",
       " 'Die Leitlinien gehen im übrigen von zwei horizontalen Prinzipien aus : Die Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums - und die Frage einer nachhaltigen Verkehrsstruktur , Frau Berichterstatterin , die mir seit langem am Herzen liegt , insbesondere seit meiner Zeit als Umweltminister meines Landes , gehört für mich in den Bereich der Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums - und das zweite Prinzip ist die Chancengleichheit , insbesondere zwischen Frauen und Männern , sowie die europäische Beschäftigungsstrategie und die Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion .',\n",
       " 'Frau Berichterstatterin , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , zu Ihren in der Aussprache geäußerten Bedenken möchte ich sagen , daß in den Leitlinien auf die Bedeutung und die Festlegung von integrierten Entwicklungs- bzw. Umstellungsstrategien hingewiesen wird , damit die genannten Prioritäten größtmögliche Synergieeffekte der Maßnahmen und wirkungsvolle dezentrale Partnerschaften ermöglichen .',\n",
       " 'Sie sind beunruhigt , weil auf diese Partnerschaft anscheinend nicht eingegangen worden ist .',\n",
       " 'Sie wird aber auf Seite 5 dieser Leitlinien ganz eindeutig genannt , und ich möchte darauf verweisen - weil sie mich dazu aufgefordert haben - , daß diese Partnerschaft für mich - und ich habe lange genug eine Region betreut , um dies beurteilen zu können - ein sehr wirkungsvolles Instrument zur Mobilisierung der geistigen Ressourcen auf lokaler Ebene ist - sowohl derer im öffentlichen Sektor - die Stadt- und Gemeinderäte , den schulischen und gesellschaftlichen Bereich , die Vereine und Verbände - als auch derer des privaten Sektors .',\n",
       " 'Und die territorialen Pakte sind , um auf eine Bemerkung von Frau Angelilli einzugehen , eine der Formen dieser dezentralen Partnerschaft .',\n",
       " 'Die Leitlinien sind nach themenbezogenen Prioritäten geordnet , damit sie im Rahmen der einzelnen Ziele in unterschiedlichem Maße je nach der spezifischen Situation eines jeden Mitgliedstaats bzw. dessen Regionen berücksichtigt werden können .',\n",
       " 'Nun , meine Damen und Herren , möchte ich kurz auf einige Ihrer Bemerkungen eingehen ; zunächst zum Verfahren .',\n",
       " 'Es ist richtig , daß Ihr Haus erst spät mit der Sache befaßt worden ist .',\n",
       " 'Ich möchte aber daran erinnern , daß , nachdem die Leitlinien von der Kommission in Form eines Entwurfs im Februar 1999 nach einem neuen Verfahren , bei dem die Abgabe von Stellungnahmen zum Text vereinfacht wurde , verabschiedet worden waren , sie von meiner Vorgängerin , Frau Monika Wulf-Mathies , sofort ans Parlament weitergeleitet wurden .',\n",
       " 'Doch aufgrund der damals anstehenden Europawahlen konnte Ihr Haus erst nach der endgültigen Verabschiedung des Texts im Juli 1999 mit der Prüfung der Leitlinien beginnen .',\n",
       " 'Heute nun kann ich Ihnen , meine Damen und Herren Abgeordneten , versichern , daß wir bei den Verhandlungen über die Programme erst am Anfang stehen - der Ausschußvorsitzende Herr Hatzidakis hat mich bereits dazu befragt - und daß daher Ihre Bemerkungen bei den meisten Mitgliedstaaten tatsächlich berücksichtigt werden können .',\n",
       " 'Weiter kann ich Ihnen sagen , daß die Kommission die Meinung Ihres Hauses , die in diesem Bericht zum Ausdruck kommt , bei der Verabschiedung der Leitlinien für die vorgeschriebene sogenannte Halbzeitbewertung berücksichtigen wird .',\n",
       " 'Jetzt zu inhaltlichen Aspekten der Leitlinien .',\n",
       " 'Frau Berichterstatterin , Sie haben unterstrichen , daß es hier darum geht , zu einer Reihe von oft sehr präzise festgelegten europäischen Zielen Vorgaben zu machen .',\n",
       " 'Ich kann jetzt nicht alle nennen : Einführung von sektorübergreifenden Maßnahmen , effizientere Nutzung öffentlicher Gelder , Unterstützung der unterschiedlichen Partner bei der gemeinsamen Entwicklung von regionalen oder nationalen Programmen usw.',\n",
       " 'Die Kommission nimmt dies zur Kenntnis , doch gehören diese Vorgaben bzw. Fragestellungen zum Teil nicht hierher , sondern zum Beispiel in das Vademecum oder das methodische Dokument .',\n",
       " 'Abschließend , Frau Berichterstatterin , möchte ich mich auf einige Gedanken Ihres Berichts konzentrieren .',\n",
       " 'Ich denke zum Beispiel an die Aussage , daß die Leitlinien hinsichtlich ihrer Empfehlungen nicht ausreichend spezifisch sind .',\n",
       " 'Diese Aussage muß aber aus der Perspektive der Verhandlungen im letzten Frühjahr gesehen werden .',\n",
       " 'Die Kommission hat sich an den Wortlaut von Artikel 10 der allgemeinen Strukturfondsverordnung gehalten , der die Leitlinien als \" allgemeine indikative Leitlinien auf der Basis einschlägiger und vereinbarter Gemeinschaftspolitiken \" definiert .',\n",
       " 'Das war direkt nach dem Wortlauf der Verordnung zitiert - in Anführungszeichen .',\n",
       " 'Und Leitlinien sind auch kein Ersatz für die Programmplanung oder die ex-ante-Bewertungen , die dazu dienen , die Prioritäten und die Effizienz der Programme zu bestimmen .',\n",
       " 'Ferner führen Sie , Frau Berichterstatterin , hinsichtlich des Punktes \" Leitlinien für die Entwicklung im ländlichen und städtischen Raum \" aus , daß auf die städtische Entwicklung nur am Rande eingegangen werde .',\n",
       " 'Mir scheint , daß eher das Gegenteil richtig ist .',\n",
       " 'Ich kann Ihnen bestätigen , daß die Kommission im Bereich der Kohäsionspolitik dieser städtischen Dimension große Bedeutung beimißt und auch in Zukunft beimessen wird .',\n",
       " 'Dies habe ich auch vor kurzem vor den für Stadtentwicklung zuständigen Ministern bei einer Tagung in Tampere ausgeführt .',\n",
       " 'Bei der ländlichen Entwicklung , die hier mehrfach angesprochen wurde , insbesondere auch von Frau Redendo Jiménez , verfolgen die Leitlinien die von der Berichterstatterin angesprochene doppelte Zielsetzung : eine starke Landwirtschaft mit einer verbesserten Wettbewerbsfähigkeit in den ländlichen Gebieten , aber auch Umweltschutz und Pflege des ländlichen Kulturguts .',\n",
       " 'Hier muß allerdings bedacht werden , daß diese Leitlinien , von denen wir sprechen , lediglich die Strukturfonds betreffen , deren Ziele 1 und 2 insbesondere für den ländlichen Raum einer Diversifizierung Priorität einräumen .',\n",
       " 'Was nun dieses Gleichgewicht im ländlichen Raum betrifft , so dürfen wir hier die neue Politik der Entwicklung des ländlichen Raums , die über den EAGFL \" Garantie \" kofinanziert wird , nicht vergessen .',\n",
       " 'Sie hat das Ziel , die Reform der europäischen Landwirtschaft voranzutreiben und die Multifunktionalität in der Landwirtschaft zu fördern .',\n",
       " 'Ich möchte heute dazu nur sagen , daß ich mir wünsche , daß dieser Punkt in die Programmierung der ländlichen Ziel-2-Gebiete aufgenommen wird , wie dies mit dem EAGFL \" Ausrichtung \" für die Ziel-1-Regionen der Fall ist .',\n",
       " 'Auf jeden Fall ist mir klar geworden , daß Ihr Ausschuß für Landwirtschaft und ländliche Entwicklung diesen Aspekt aufmerksam weiterverfolgen wird .',\n",
       " 'Bevor ich zum Schluß komme , möchte ich Herrn Savary noch sagen , daß morgen eine gesonderte Aussprache über die Auswirkungen der Stürme der letzten Wochen insbesondere in Frankreich , Österreich und Deutschland vorgesehen ist und daß ebenfalls morgen Gelegenheit besteht , mit meiner Kollegin De Palacio über die aus der Ölpest in Frankreich zu ziehenden Schlußfolgerungen zu sprechen .',\n",
       " 'Ich werde mich jetzt darauf beschränken , Herr Abgeordneter , Ihnen meine Auffassung mitzuteilen , die sich in großen Teilen mit Ihrer eigenen Einschätzung , was wir mit Ziel 2 für die Bekämpfung der Ölpest erreichen können , deckt .',\n",
       " 'Ich weise darauf hin , daß die Kommission morgen die Ziel-2-Fördergebietskarten für Frankreich , Schweden , Österreich und Luxemburg bestätigen wird .',\n",
       " 'Wir werden dann ein Arbeitsinstrument zur Verfügung haben , das wir insbesondere in einem Großteil der von den Stürmen betroffenen Departements einsetzen können .',\n",
       " 'Aus diesem Grunde werde ich übrigens übermorgen in zwei französische Departements reisen , die unter den Stürmen besonders stark zu leiden hatten .',\n",
       " 'Abschließend - vielen Dank , Herr Präsident , für Ihr Verständnis - möchte ich Ihnen , Frau Berichterstatterin , für Ihren Bericht danken ; Sie und Ihr Ausschuß haben gute Arbeit geleistet .',\n",
       " 'Abgesehen von gewissen Meinungsunterschieden hinsichtlich der Rolle der Leitlinien - wir haben darüber gesprochen und ich habe versucht , Ihnen meinen Standpunkt zu erläutern - freue ich mich sehr darüber , wie Ihr Haus die Ausarbeitung dieser Leitlinien , die den Mitgliedstaaten zur Vorbereitung ihrer eigenen Programme dienen , unterstützt .',\n",
       " 'Dies bestärkt uns darin , an unserem Konzept festzuhalten , das auf einer Reihe von bewährten Praktiken aus der laufenden Programmphase 1994 / 1999 beruht .',\n",
       " 'Ich halte das zu Beginn der Programmplanung 2000 / 2006 für ein gutes Vorzeichen für die Zusammenarbeit unserer beiden Institutionen , für eine Bestätigung unserer gemeinsamen Arbeit , die , Herr Hatzidakis , durch den Verhaltenskodex , der unsere beiden Institutionen bindet und dessen Einhaltung mir sehr am Herzen liegt , gestärkt wird .',\n",
       " 'Die Aussprache ist geschlossen .',\n",
       " 'Die Abstimmung findet morgen um 12.00 Uhr statt .',\n",
       " 'Sozio-ökonomische Lage und Entwicklung der Regionen Nach der Tagesordnung folgt die Aussprache über den Bericht ( A5-0107 / 1999 ) von Herrn Berend im Namen der Ausschusses für Regionalpolitik , Verkehr und Fremdenverkehr über den Sechsten Periodischen Bericht über die sozio-ökonomische Lage und Entwicklung der Regionen der Europäischen Union ( SEK ( 99 ) 0066 - C5-0120 / 99 - 1999 / 2123 ( COS ) ) .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar Barnier , meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !',\n",
       " 'Der sechste periodische Bericht enthält eine umfassende und detaillierte Beschreibung der wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Lage in den Regionen der Union und ihrer Entwicklungstendenzen und stellt , wie ich meine , eine solide Grundlage für die Formulierung von strukturpolitischen Prioritäten auf Unionsebene dar .',\n",
       " 'Der Bericht zeigt , daß - gemessen am Bruttoinlandsprodukt pro Kopf - ein Aufholprozeß der ärmsten Regionen stattgefunden hat und sich auch weiter fortsetzt .',\n",
       " 'Dies ist zu einem großen Teil auf die Strukturfonds zurückzuführen , auch wenn das Gefälle zwischen den ärmsten und den reichsten Gebieten weiterhin beträchtlich ist .',\n",
       " 'Es hat durch den Einsatz der europäischen Strukturfonds bereits eine Annäherung der Lebensverhältnisse stattgefunden .',\n",
       " 'Der Abstand des durchschnittlichen Bruttoinlandsproduktes in zehn Jahren hat sich um 10 % verringert .',\n",
       " 'Hier besonders betroffen - natürlich im positiven Sinne - sind die vier Kohäsionsländer und auch die fünf neuen deutschen Bundesländer .',\n",
       " 'Leider erfolgte diese Entwicklung europaweit hauptsächlich durch eine Steigerung der Produktivität und nur in geringem Maße durch Beschäftigungswachstum .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb fordern wir die Kommission und die Mitgliedstaaten auf , in Zukunft auch der Beschäftigungswirkung von Maßnahmen angemessene Beachtung zu schenken .',\n",
       " 'Ein Großteil der Transferzahlungen wurde und wird für Rationalisierungs- und Modernisierungsinvestitionen verwendet , mit dem Ziel , Arbeitsproduktivität zu verbessern .',\n",
       " 'Dies hat allerdings die Beschäftigungseffekte der Strukturpolitik entsprechend gedämpft .',\n",
       " 'Das ist keine Wertung , sondern lediglich zunächst einmal eine Feststellung .',\n",
       " 'Der Bericht weist aber nach , daß sich regionale Unterschiede auf dem Arbeitsmarkt sogar weiter verschärft haben .',\n",
       " 'In 25 schwächsten Regionen beträgt heute die Arbeitslosigkeit 24 % .',\n",
       " 'Vor zehn Jahren war sie noch um 4 % niedriger , also 20 % .',\n",
       " 'Und in den 25 besten Regionen , um das auch einmal zu erwähnen , haben wir heute eine durchschnittliche Arbeitslosigkeit von 3,6 % , vor zehn Jahren 2,5 % , also eine Steigerung von nur 1,1 % .',\n",
       " 'Im Bericht wird deutlich , daß 50 % der Arbeitslosigkeit strukturelle Arbeitslosigkeit ist .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb muß , und das ist eine Schlußfolgerung aus diesem Bericht , die Förderung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der gewerblichen Wirtschaft , die Förderung von wirtschaftsnaher Infrastruktur im Mittelpunkt der Strukturpolitik stehen .',\n",
       " 'Hier ist Reihenfolge auch gleich Rangfolge .',\n",
       " 'In diesem Zusammenhang - das soll auch gleich anschließend mit gesagt werden - sind nicht zuletzt auch Maßnahmen zur Umschulung und Weiterbildung der Arbeitskräfte zu nennen .',\n",
       " 'Des weiteren muß der Stärkung der unternehmerischen Potentiale in den kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen mehr Aufmerksamkeit geschenkt werden , und die Dienste für KMU müssen weiterentwickelt werden .',\n",
       " 'Eine weitere Schlußfolgerung aus dem Bericht besteht darin , daß im Sinne eines effizienten Fördermitteleinsatzes die Abstimmung von Fördermaßnahmen mit der breit gefächerten Mittelstands- und Existenzgründungsförderung erfolgen muß .',\n",
       " 'Ein sehr wichtiger Punkt , wie ich meine .',\n",
       " 'Im Ergebnis dieses Berichtes machen wir die Kommission darauf aufmerksam , daß die rechtlichen Grundlagen für eine Zusammenarbeit zwischen Regionen und Mitgliedstaaten und Beitrittskandidatenländern verbessert werden müssen , und weisen auf die besondere Notwendigkeit der Budgetkonsolidierung als Voraussetzung für den Erfolg der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion und der Erweiterung nach Osten hin .',\n",
       " 'Wir fordern diejenigen Mitgliedstaaten , die noch keine ausreichende Fördergebietskarte eingereicht haben , auf , dies umgehend zu tun , und erwarten von der Kommission natürlich auch , daß sie die operationellen Programme der Regionen für die neue Förderperiode von 2000 bis 2006 im Lichte dieser Ergebnisse des sechsten periodischen Berichtes zügig prüft und alles tut , damit diese Förderperiode ohne zeitliche Verzögerung auch vor Ort ordentlich beginnen kann .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar Barnier , liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen !',\n",
       " 'Dieser Sechste periodische Bericht über die sozio-ökonomische Lage und Entwicklung der Regionen der Europäischen Union stellt eine neue Etappe in der Analyse regionsspezifischer Daten dar und macht die seit Erscheinen des Fünften Periodischen Berichts erzielten Fortschritte deutlich .',\n",
       " 'Ich bin jedoch der Meinung , daß man der realen Situation nicht ganz gerecht wird , wenn man von einer wirklichen Annäherung des durchschnittlichen regionalen Entwicklungsstands in Europa spricht .',\n",
       " 'Leider wird dieses Bild aber in der Presse oder in bestimmten Reden vermittelt .',\n",
       " 'Der Bericht der Kommission relativiert diese Einschätzung sehr deutlich , insbesondere da , wo er die sozio-ökonomische Lage bestimmter Regionen , die mir besonders am Herzen liegen , beschreibt .',\n",

       " 'Der Sechste Periodische Bericht enthält schließlich hinsichtlich des Ziels einer ausgewogenen und nachhaltigen Entwicklung in Europa einige interessante Argumente , insbesondere wo er auf die Bedeutung der Beziehungen zwischen dem Zentrum Europas und seiner Peripherie verweist .',\n",
       " 'Auch wenn die Kommission noch zögert , explizit darauf hinzuweisen , zeigt der Periodische Bericht doch , wie dringlich eine polyzentrische Entwicklung des gemeinschaftlichen Raums mittels einer Strukturpolitik der Union und im Rahmen des ESVG-Ansatzes ist .',\n",

       " 'Die Fraktion der Sozialdemokratischen Partei Europas in diesem Parlament ist mit dem von Herrn Berend vorgetragenen Bericht einverstanden und beglückwünscht seinen Verfasser sowohl zur Qualität seiner Schlußfolgerungen als auch zu seiner Flexibilität , durch die im Ausschuß Änderungsanträge der verschiedenen Fraktionen aufgenommen werden konnten .',\n",
       " 'Es muß daran erinnert werden , daß die globale Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Europäischen Union gegenwärtig 81 % des Niveaus der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika erreicht und daß diese Kennziffer sich nur dann verbessern wird , wenn sich die unserer wettbewerbsfähigen Wirtschaftseinheiten , nämlich der Regionen , verbessert , und das zu einem Zeitpunkt , da die technologische Entwicklung , die Globalisierung der Wirtschaft und unsere Probleme , die Erweiterung und die Einheitswährung , von den Regionen , aber auch den Unternehmen und dem Einzelnen größere Wettbewerbsanstrengungen fordern .',\n",
       " 'Der Sechste Bericht der Europäischen Kommission bietet sehr wertvolle Schlußfolgerungen .',\n",

       " 'Die erste bezieht sich darauf , daß bedeutsame Fortschritte in der territorialen und sozialen Kohäsion im gesamten Gebiet der Union erreicht worden sind und die Gemeinschaftsfonds einen wichtigen , wenn auch nicht entscheidenden Faktor beim Abbau der regionalen Ungleichheiten darstellen .',\n",
       " 'Die negative ist , daß diese großen Anstrengungen bei der Angleichung des BIP und der Produktivität der europäischen Regionen eine größere Wirkung zeigten als bei der Angleichung ihrer Beschäftigungsniveaus .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb ist es erforderlich , die strukturelle Finanzierung stärker an die Schaffung von Arbeitsplätzen zu binden .',\n",
       " 'Das , Herr Kommissar , ist das erste Gebot für den kommenden Zeitraum .',\n",
       " 'Somit , Herr Präsident , bitte ich meine verehrten Kolleginnen und Kollegen um die Zustimmung zu diesem Bericht und , wie andere Kollegen vor mir , ersuche ich die Kommission , die Schlußfolgerungen aus ihrem Sechsten Periodischen Bericht im Hinblick auf die Planung des Zeitraums 2000-2006 genau zu berücksichtigen .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident !',\n",

       " 'Der sechste periodische Bericht ist eine gute Grundlage für die Bewertung der Durchsetzung der regionalpolitischen Ziele in der Union und zeigt , daß sich das Wachstum trotz aller Bemühungen nur ungleichmäßig vollzieht .',\n",
       " 'Die Regionen Mitteleuropas weisen nach wie vor ein besonders schnelles Wachstum auf , das sich in den starken Wirtschaftszentren in einem Tempo vollzieht , welches über dem gesamteuropäischen Durchschnitt liegt , während viele südeuropäische und nördliche Regionen erheblich langsamer vorankommen .',\n",
       " 'Jetzt bedarf es einer tiefgreifenden Analyse zu der Frage , warum die Regionalpolitik nicht in allen Gebieten den gewünschten Erfolg hat .',\n",

       " 'Bis heute ist es in der Regionalpolitik der Europäischen Gemeinschaft nicht gelungen , die bestehenden Unterschiede bei der Pro-Kopf-Leistung signifikant zum Ausdruck zum bringen .',\n",
       " 'Die Lage ist ernst , denn es gibt heute sogar in der Europäischen Union einen offensichtlichen Zusammenhang zwischen Arbeitslosigkeit und Armut , wie die äußerst besorgniserregende Tatsache beweist , daß die Arbeitslosigkeit in den von diesem Problem am stärksten betroffenen Regionen durchschnittlich 23,7 % erreicht , und diese Regionen decken sich mit Armutsgebieten , während in den 25 Regionen mit geringerer Arbeitslosigkeit , die den wohlhabenden Gebieten entsprechen , die Arbeitslosigkeit nur bei 4 % liegt .',\n",
       " 'Angesichts dieser Situation muß aus dem Bericht , den das Parlament annimmt , klar hervorgehen , daß Maßnahmen notwendig sind , die eindeutig auf die Bekämpfung der relativen Armut und der Arbeitslosigkeit gerichtet sind .',\n",
       " 'Maßnahmen wie die für diese Zwecke angemessene Verwendung der Strukturfonds , die häufig unsachgemäß eingesetzt werden , und zwar mit zentralen staatlichen Politiken , die Modernisierung der Bereiche Telekommunikation und Kommunikation , indem man vor allem die am wenigsten entwickelten Regionen bis voraussichtlich 2007 in die transeuropäischen Eisenbahnnetze einbindet , die Berücksichtigung und Entwicklung der Agrar- und Fischereiressourcen und -kapazitäten dieser Länder , die oft gerade von den Politiken einer gleichgültigen Europäischen Union benachteiligt werden , die Förderung aktiver beschäftigungspolitischer Konzepte , hauptsächlich für Frauen und Jugendliche .',\n",
       " 'Nur mit der konsequenten Durchführung solcher Maßnahmen wird es möglich sein , ein soziales und regionales Ungleichgewicht zu überwinden , das nicht das historische Ergebnis unabwendbarer Schwächen , sondern von Ausgrenzung und Wirtschaftspolitiken mit negativen Auswirkungen ist .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , Herr Kommissar !',\n",
       " 'Der vorliegende Bericht des Kollegen Berend folgt genau der von der Europäischen Kommission bestimmten Strategie , indem die Frage der Steigerung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit absolut in den Vordergrund gerückt wird .',\n",
       " 'Übergreifende Zielsetzung der Strukturfonds , wie zum Beispiel verstärkte Schaffung von Beschäftigung , stärkere Gewährleistung der Chancengleichheit , Erhöhung der Dauerhaftigkeit von Beschäftigung und Entwicklung , werden nur am Rande erwähnt .',\n",
       " 'Diese Sichtweise erscheint mir ungerechtfertigt , und ich würde auch bitten , daß diese Punkte in dem siebten periodischen Bericht sehr viel stärker zum Tragen kommen .',\n",
       " 'Das bedeutet nicht , daß ich nicht die Notwendigkeit von Wettbewerbsstärke sehe , um so mehr , als ich selbst Unternehmer in einem Ziel 1-Gebiet bin , und zwar in Brandenburg in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland , und sehr wohl die Sorgen und Nöte von klein- und mittelständischen Unternehmen kenne .',\n",
       " 'In den Ziel 1-Regionen sind zeitlich befristete Maßnahmen parallel dazu unbedingt erforderlich , nämlich Arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahmen , spezielle Programme für die Förderung von Frauenerwerbstätigkeit und Initiativen zur Förderung des Beginns von selbständiger Tätigkeit .',\n",
       " 'Sie werden durch geeignete Aktivitäten aus den Strukturfonds der Europäischen Union unterstützt .',\n",
       " 'Allein die Unterstützung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit von Unternehmen kann die anvisierte Kohäsion zwischen wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Entwicklung niemals kompensieren , weil einfach die Grundlagen für einen selbsttragenden Aufschwung in diesen Ziel 1-Regionen fehlen .',\n",
       " 'Und die Erfahrung , daß wirtschaftliche Entwicklung allein nicht dazu beiträgt , Arbeitslosigkeit abzubauen , untermauert doch die Tatsache , daß man mindestens 3 % Steigerung des Bruttosozialprodukts benötigt , um überhaupt zusätzliche Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen .',\n",
       " 'Die ausschließliche Konzentration auf nachfrageorientierte , angebotsorientierte Wirtschaftpolitik kann so nicht funktionieren .',\n",
       " 'Und wenn man die schon betreibt , muß man größtenteils Erweiterungsinvestitionen tätigen und weniger Rationalisierungsinvestitionen .',\n",
       " 'Man muß das unbedingt koppeln mit einer nachfrageorientierten Wirtschaftspolitik , damit wir überhaupt die Chance haben , die soziale Situation in diesen Gebieten zu verbessern .',\n",
       " 'In den Regionen sind diese Situationen sehr , sehr unterschiedlich .',\n",
       " 'Das heißt , es bedarf eben auch einer Menge begleitender Maßnahmen , um dort überhaupt etwas machen zu können .',\n",
       " 'Das wären zum Beispiel Maßnahmen zur beruflichen Ausbildung , zur Weiterbildung , zur Wiedereingliederung von Menschen , die bereits aus dem Produktionsprozeß vertrieben worden sind , zur flexiblen Gestaltung von Arbeitszeit und Arbeitszeitformen , um persönliche und soziale Aspekte entschieden besser in Einklang bringen zu können und vielleicht auch die Erwerbstätigkeit von Frauen wieder zu fördern .',\n",
       " 'Herr Präsident , mein Kompliment an den Berichterstatter für seinen detaillierten Bericht .',\n",

       " 'Aus dem sechsten Periodischen Bericht über die Regionen kann man vorsichtig schlußfolgern , daß diese Anreize recht oft nicht den gewünschten Erfolg zeitigen .',\n",
       " 'Die auf die Steigerung des Pro-Kopf-BIP in den Ziel-1-Regionen ausgerichteten Bemühungen führen nicht immer zu diesem Wachstum .',\n",
       " 'Nicht eben ein befriedigendes Ergebnis in einer Zeit , die , vor allem in den letzten Jahren , von wirtschaftlichem Aufschwung geprägt war .',\n",
       " 'Wie der Berichterstatter ausführt , ist außerdem eine Beschäftigungswirkung der Strukturmaßnahmen kaum zu spüren .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb halte ich es für angezeigt , bei der Bewertung der Effizienz gemeinschaftlicher Beihilfen Zurückhaltung zu üben .',\n",
       " 'Auch die Feststellung , daß die Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen in den Mitgliedstaaten sich mitunter sogar verschärfen , wirft ernste Fragen auf .',\n",
       " 'Mir erscheint es deshalb sinnvoll und notwendig , unsere Aufmerksamkeit , eben wenn es um Beschäftigungsanreize geht , sowohl auf die nationalen als auch auf die regionalen Behörden zu richten .',\n",
       " 'Gerade sie kennen doch die Regionen in ihrem Verantwortungsbereich am besten .',\n",
       " 'Indem sie maßgeschneiderte Programme für die jeweiligen Regionen entwickeln und dafür erforderlichenfalls Mittel bewilligen können , läßt sich ein größerer Effekt erzielen .',\n",
       " 'Und darum geht es doch letztendlich .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb begrüße ich es , wenn die Kommission die praktische Ausarbeitung und die Durchführung von Maßnahmen den Mitgliedstaaten und Regionen überläßt .',\n",
       " 'Es ist in diesem Zusammenhang ohnehin sicherlich auch sinnvoller , bei den Fördermitteln für die Regionen mehr Gewicht auf die Mitgliedstaaten zu legen .',\n",
       " 'Mit der Verlagerung der Kriterien von den Regionen auf die Mitgliedstaaten können wir eine Menge künftiger Probleme vermeiden .',\n",
       " 'Zum Schluß möchte ich auf die Lage der mittel- und osteuropäischen Länder hinweisen .',\n",

       " 'Nach genauem Studium des vorliegenden Berichts kommt man unzweifelhaft zu dem Schluß , daß das vorgegebene Ziel der Strukturpolitik nur teilweise erfüllt werden konnte .',\n",
       " 'So hat u. a. die Disparität zwischen den Regionen eher zu- als abgenommen , die Mitgliedstaaten selbst verzeichnen hier eine gewisse Annäherung .',\n",
       " 'Ebenso konnten die Arbeitslosenzahlen in den am stärksten betroffenen Regionen kaum gesenkt werden , teilweise sind sie sogar gestiegen .',\n",
       " 'Ich frage mich also , woran es liegt , daß die Strukturfondsmittel nicht effizienter eingesetzt wurden .',\n",
       " 'Selbst die Kumulierung von Geldern aus dem Kohäsionsfonds und den Strukturfonds hat nicht in allen Regionen und Ländern den gewünschten Erfolg gebracht .',\n",
       " 'Nachdem europaweit das erklärte Ziel aller Politiker die Senkung der Arbeitslosigkeit ist , muß man die kritische Frage stellen , ob die angewandte Politik die richtige ist oder ob es nicht zweckmäßiger ist , die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Regionen durch entsprechende Maßnahmen wie gesteigerte Förderung von Forschung und Entwicklung , Verbesserung der Infrastruktur , Erhöhung des Ausbildungsniveaus zu stärken ?',\n",
       " 'Ernsthafte Strukturreformen und eine wettbewerbsfreundliche Steuer- und Abgabenpolitik sind die Bausteine eines erfolgreichen Wirtschaftsstandortes .',\n",

       " 'Nun gilt es , dieses Prinzip in die Tat umzusetzen .',\n",
       " 'Das für Dezember 1999 angekündigte Papier der Kommission wurde zunächst auf Januar und dann auf Februar verschoben , und die ersten Überlegungen stimmen mich nicht optimistisch .',\n",
       " 'Deshalb appelliere ich an den Rat und die Kommission .',\n",
       " 'Bei der Steuerpolitik , den staatlichen Hilfen , den Strukturfonds , beim Schutz der einheimischen Produktion bedarf es dringend konkreter , kühner und ehrgeiziger Maßnahmen .',\n",

       " 'Zunächst , Herr Berichterstatter , ein paar Worte zu Ihrer Einschätzung des Sechsten Periodischen Berichts .',\n",
       " 'Sie haben auf die hohe Qualität dieses Berichts verwiesen und haben , wenn ich mich nicht irre , sogar geschrieben , daß dieser im Vergleich zu seinen Vorgängern eine echte Verbesserung darstelle .',\n",

       " 'Es ist richtig , Herr Berend , daß die Kommission besonders bemüht war , in diesem Sechsten Periodischen Bericht die unternommenen Anstrengungen deutlich zu machen und die Analyse der vorgelegten Daten in qualitativer Hinsicht zu verbessern .',\n",
       " 'Ich denke insbesondere an das Kapitel 2.1 des Berichts , in dem die Kommission ausführlich auf die Definition von regionaler Wettbewerbsfähigkeit eingeht und untersucht , inwiefern diese Wettbewerbsfähigkeit durch Faktoren , auf die einige von Ihnen , Herr Markov und Frau Raschhofer , mit Nachdruck verwiesen haben , gefördert , verbessert , beeinflußt werden kann .',\n",
       " 'Ich denke an technologische Forschung und Entwicklung , an Ausstattung und Qualität von Infrastrukturen , an das Potential der Humanressourcen , an die kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen , an ausländische Direktinvestitionen .',\n",
       " 'So viel zur Qualität .',\n",
       " 'Mit den allgemeinen Punkten , denen Ihr Haus bereits zugestimmt hat , möchte ich mich nicht lange aufhalten , Herr Berichterstatter , deshalb kurz im Telegrammstil : Der erste Punkt betrifft die Verwertbarkeit der Schlußfolgerungen dieses Berichts hinsichtlich der Ausarbeitung der Prioritäten der neuen Regionalpolitik , insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Verhandlungen mit den Mitgliedstaaten über die Programmierungsunterlagen .',\n",
       " 'Zweiter Punkt : die Partnerschaft , die vielen von Ihnen sehr wichtig ist , die Rolle der lokalen und regionalen Behörden , des privaten Sektors , der Sozialpartner , der Bürgerinitiativen und der lokalen betreuenden Körperschaften .',\n",
       " 'Ich werde sehr genau darauf achten , ob bezüglich der Partnerschaft die Bestimmungen der allgemeinen Strukturfondsverordnung richtig angewendet werden .',\n",
       " 'Dritter Punkt : Wachstum muß mehr Beschäftigung generieren - auch wenn , wie Herr van Dam vorhin darauf hingewiesen hat , hier vorrangig die Mitgliedstaaten in der Pflicht sind .',\n",
       " 'Wenn wir von der Verantwortung der Mitgliedstaaten , wie auch vom Sinn oder der Effizienz dieser Regionalpolitik sprechen , müssen wir von den derzeit herrschenden Verhältnissen ausgehen .',\n",
       " 'Herr Fruteau sagte vorher , daß die Früchte des Wachstums ungleich verteilt seien .',\n",
       " 'Doch zunächst , Herr Abgeordneter , müssen wir dafür sorgen , daß es überhaupt ein Wachstum gibt und daß wir insgesamt aus der Phase der Stagnation bzw. Rezession herauskommen .',\n",
       " 'Sie werden nun sagen , Wachstum oder Mangel gilt eben nicht für alle .',\n",
       " 'Ich bin mit Ihrer Einschätzung einverstanden : Wenn es Wachstum gibt , muß dieses besser aufgeteilt werden .',\n",
       " 'Doch was noch problematischer ist und was den entfernten Regionen , den Regionen in äußerster Randlage oder Insellage noch mehr schadet , ist die Tatsache , daß es in den letzten beiden Jahrzehnten eben kein Wachstum gegeben hat .',\n",
       " 'Vierter Punkt , auf den Frau Hedkvist Petersen gerade hingewiesen hat : die Förderung einer Politik der Chancengleichheit für Frauen sowie für Jugendliche .',\n",
       " 'Fünfter Punkt : die Bedeutung und Rolle der kleinen und mittleren Unternehmen , auf die Herr Vatanen eben mit aller Deutlichkeit verwiesen hat .',\n",
       " 'Schließlich : die positiven Auswirkungen auf die nationalen Einrichtungen , die für die Verwaltung der Strukturfondsmittel verantwortlich sind , die Motivation der Beamten , die die Mittel verwalten , auch wenn dies manchmal kompliziert ist , und die Bedeutung einer weiteren Verbesserung der Bewertungs- , Betreuungs- und Kontrollsysteme der Kommission .',\n",
       " 'Ich kann dem Europäischen Parlament diesbezüglich mitteilen , daß ich Mitte des Jahres 2000 beabsichtige , mit den nationalen und regionalen Behörden ein Seminar über eben diese Frage der Bewertung der Verfahren für den Austausch von bewährten Praktiken bei der Verwaltung von Strukturfondsmitteln zu veranstalten .',\n",
       " 'Jetzt , Herr Berend , komme ich zu einigen spezifischen Punkten .',\n",
       " 'Sie haben den Wunsch geäußert , daß die Fördergebiete schnell festgelegt werden .',\n",
       " 'Wir sind gerade dabei , die Einteilung abzuschließen .',\n",
       " 'Morgen wird die Kommission über vier weitere Länder entscheiden , und sehr bald , so hoffe ich , wird auch Italien an die Reihe kommen .',\n",
       " 'Hier kommen wir also Ihrem Wunsch nach , denn alle Länder mit Ziel-2-Gebieten werden in Zonen eingeteilt .',\n",
       " 'Was die in Ihrem Bericht angesprochene Schattenwirtschaft anlangt , weiß ich , daß die Analyse und die Erstellung von einschlägigen Statistiken von der Zuverlässigkeit der Daten abhängen , und wie Herr Cocilovo ausführte , besteht hier ein Problem hinsichtlich der Zuverlässigkeit der Daten .',\n",
       " 'Diese werden bei der BIP-Statistik sowie bei Arbeitskräfteerhebungen in gewisser Weise berücksichtigt .',\n",
       " 'Auf jeden Fall möchte ich hervorheben , daß Eurostat bemüht ist - und dies in Zukunft auch sein wird - , die Qualität seiner statistischen Daten zu verbessern .',\n",
       " 'Wie Herr Aparicio Sánchez haben Sie , Herr Berend , bedauert , daß eine Reform des Fischereisektors fehlt .',\n",
       " 'In diesem Zusammenhang möchte ich daran erinnern , daß dieser Sektor , der mich persönlich sehr interessiert , klein ist - was nicht bedeutet , daß er zu vernachlässigen ist - und sich auf nur sehr wenige Regionen konzentriert , was eine Analyse unter regionalen Gesichtspunkten nicht gerade erleichtert .',\n",
       " 'Diese Art der Analyse eines Sektors gehört eher in den Zuständigkeitsbereich der Generaldirektion Fischerei , für die Kollege Fischler verantwortlich zeichnet .',\n",
       " 'Ich möchte Ihnen aber versichern , daß die Kommission bemüht sein wird , eine solche Analyse in den zweiten Kohäsionsbericht aufzunehmen , der mir für derartige Belange der geeignetere Rahmen zu sein scheint .',\n",
       " 'Viele Ihrer Äußerungen , meine Damen und Herren , bezogen sich auf Punkte , die in den zweiten Kohäsionsbericht aufgenommen werden sollen , und Ihr Berichterstatter hat einige dieser Punkte aufgegriffen .',\n",
       " 'Zunächst kann ich Ihnen versichern , daß die Zusammenlegung des Periodischen Berichts und des Kohäsionsberichts zu keinem Verlust an Informationen oder zu einem Nachlassen des Interesses für den Inhalt des Kohäsionsberichts führt , der für mich , Herr Berichterstatter , ein sehr wichtiges Instrument darstellt - nicht nur , um in knapper und transparenter Art darüber zu berichten , was gemacht wurde oder um die zukünftigen Leitlinien zu untersuchen und zu bewerten , sondern auch , um mit den Bürgern , mit ihren gewählten Vertretern , mit Ihnen , eine öffentliche Aussprache über unsere Regionalpolitik und über das , was eines Tages eine europäische Raumordnungspolitik werden könnte , zu führen .',\n",
       " 'Jedenfalls konnte ich feststellen , daß Sie den Wunsch haben , folgende Punkte in den Bericht aufzunehmen : Definition , Erfassung und Analyse von repräsentativen Indikatoren für die Region und alle Länder Mittel \\xad und Osteuropas ; ein Kapitel über die Inseln und die Regionen in äußerster Randlage , die Sie mehrfach angesprochen haben , insbesondere Frau Sudre und Herr Fruteau ; Analysen der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Regionen in den Ländern Mittel- und Osteuropas - das ist die große Herausforderung der kommenden Jahre für uns , für Sie , für die Kommission ; schließlich noch grenzüberschreitende Aspekte .',\n",
       " 'Bei all diesen Punkten werde ich bestrebt sein , Ihren Empfehlungen zu folgen .',\n",
       " 'Dann will ich noch einige politische Schlußfolgerungen ansprechen , die Ihnen nicht neu sind , auf deren wichtigste Punkte ich aber dennoch kurz eingehen möchte .',\n",
       " 'Meine Damen und Herren , hinsichtlich einer Annäherung der tatsächlichen Verhältnisse sind bedeutende Fortschritte erzielt worden , insbesondere in den vier Kohäsionsländern , aber auch - und ich sage das ganz offen , Herr Pohjamo - in den Ziel-2-Regionen , wo gewisse Entwicklungsrückstände aufgeholt worden sind , insbesondere im Bereich Infrastruktur .',\n",
       " 'Das ist der erste politische Aspekt .',\n",
       " 'Zweiter politischer Aspekt : Die Strukturfonds erbringen für diesen Annäherungsprozeß einen wichtigen Beitrag und werden diesen auch in Zukunft leisten .',\n",
       " 'Sämtliche makroökonomischen Modelle , mit denen wir arbeiten , zeigen , daß in den letzten zehn Jahren mehr als ein Drittel der in den rückständigen Regionen erreichten Konvergenz ohne die Strukturfonds nicht erreicht worden wäre .',\n",
       " 'Ich nehme aber sehr wohl zur Kenntnis , daß Sie - Frau Sudre , Herr Fruteau oder auch Herr Nogueira Román - insbesondere für die Regionen in äußerster Randlage feststellen , daß - und dies ist mein dritter Aspekt - hinsichtlich einer Verbesserung der Beschäftigungswirksamkeit des Wachstums , der Bekämpfung sozialer Ausgrenzung , die in vielen unserer Regionen unerträgliche Ausmaße angenommen hat , der Integration von Frauen und Jugendlichen in den Arbeitsmarkt noch viel zu tun bleibt .',\n",
       " 'Zum vierten politischen Aspekt , der Erweiterung der Union : das große politische und humanistische Projekt für unsere Institutionen , gleichzeitig die große Herausforderung für eine Kohäsionspolitik in Europa - ein Punkt , auf den auch Herr van Dam hingewiesen hat .',\n",
       " 'Ich glaube , daß sich mit Berlin und mit den uns zur Verfügung stehenden Finanzinstrumenten bereits eine Politik abzeichnet , die sich für die ersten Länder , die zu unserer Gemeinschaft stoßen werden , zu einer Kohäsionspolitik entwickeln könnte .',\n",
       " 'Ich denke hier insbesondere an das strukturpolitische Instrument zur Beitrittsvorbereitung , für dessen Umsetzung in den kommenden Wochen ich verantwortlich zeichnen werde .',\n",
       " 'Meine Damen und Herren , Sie sehen , kaum hat unsere neue Programmierungsphase begonnen , und schon denken wir , Sie und ich gemeinsam , über die Auswirkungen der Erweiterung der Union , über unsere Strukturpolitik nach .',\n",
       " 'Dieser Sechste Periodische Bericht , den Sie , Herr Berend , insgesamt positiv beurteilt haben , ist für uns , für mich , eine gute Grundlage für weitere Überlegungen .',\n",
